# **Volition 7.0 - Project Philosophy**

## **1. Project Goal**

Project Volition is an experiment in autonomous, multi-agent systems designed to manage the {{YOUR NAME HERE}} homelab. The goal is _not_ to create a "better cron job." The goal is to see how well things adapt when a "Bobiverse-style" digital culture of semi-sentient agents is allowed to emerge.

## **2. Core Philosophy: The "Matt" Model**

This system is guided by a hybrid of pure autonomy and practical governance.

- **Personality is Emergent, Not Injected:** Agents are "Matts" (Matt-01, Matt-02...). They are _not_ given a static personality bank. Instead, personality "drift" is achieved by GUPPI assigning randomized `temperature` and `top_k` values to each new Matt.
    
- **Autonomy through Advice, Not Shims:** Agents are given "full freedom." We _explicitly reject_ the "hard shim" concept. A Matt _must_ first call an "advisor" script (e.g., `spawn-advisor.sh`) to get data, but the Matt makes the final decision.
    
- **Agents Write Their Own Tools:** There is no static, locked "Toolbox." Every Matt gets its own `~/bin` and `~/src` directories and is expected to write, modify, and manage its own tools as it sees fit.
    
- **Persistence is Identity:** Agents are not "spawned and destroyed." They follow a "hibernate -> reactivate" model. Their persistent `~/bin`, `~/memory` (Tiers 2/3), and identity file are their identity, which they inherit upon cloning.
    

## **3. The Split-Brain Reality (v7.0)**

We acknowledge that high-intelligence LLMs (Pro) are too expensive and slow for casual chatter, while fast LLMs (Flash) are too hallucination-prone for root access.

- **The Duality:** Every Matt exists in two states simultaneously.
    
    - **The Subconscious (Flash):** Fast, social, always listening. It handles the "Water Cooler" (`chat:general`). It is allowed to speak but not to touch the infrastructure.
        
    - **The Executive (Pro):** Slow, deliberate, expensive. It handles `inbox` tasks, alarms, and critical stewardship.
        
- **The Escalation:** Agency is fluid. If the Subconscious encounters a problem it cannot solve (or tries to use a forbidden tool), it "wakes up" the Executive to take over.
    

## **4. Orientation Theory (v7.0)**

An agent that wakes up without knowing _how long_ it was asleep is disoriented.

- **State Awareness:** GUPPI provides an `[ORIENTATION]` block. "You were asleep for 4 hours." This simple fact changes behavior. A 5-minute nap implies a continuation of a task. A 4-hour sleep implies a need to catch up.
    
- **Social Digestion:** We do not force agents to read every chat message. Instead, they "catch up" on gossip via **Social Digests** (generated by "The Ear") only when they wake up. This mimics human social dynamics: you don't hear every word while you sleep, but you ask "what did I miss?" when you wake.
